## Javascript Patterns

This is code is written to help understand different patterns, and show an idea how it can looks in javascript. I don't suggest to use any of this code in your project, because the idea here just to help understand patterns and keep it tiny and elegant.

Why? I was interviewed in different companies as a javascript developer and they often asked me that question: "Which patterns do you know? Can you implement this {x} pattern?".
